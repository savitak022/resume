<h3>SKILL SET</h3><hr>
Java, C, Mat lab, Python, My SQL, Oracle SQL
<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3><hr>
6 months internship on “Social Media API Connector-Twitter” using Python language at Xenolytics, a New York based company
<h3>PROJECTS</h3><hr>
<h4>Project 1</h4>
Image retrieval using color and texture features <br>
<u>Tools and technologies</u> Mat lab, Wang database
<h5><u>Description</u></h5>
The purpose of the project is to retrieve the images from a database using texture and color
features of an image. Features like Gray Level co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with color
features are extracted in RGB, HSV, and YcBcR color spaces. Images are retrieved using
similarity measures with the help of Euclidean, Manhattan and Canberra distances.
<h4>Project 2</h4>
Scalable and Secure Sharing of Personal Health Record in Cloud Computing using Attribute
based Encryption <br>
<u>Tools and technologies</u>
Apache tomcat 7, My SQL, Eclipse, Java 7, JSP, Servlets, HTML, JavaScript<br>
<h5><u>Description</u></h5>
Personal Health Record (PHR) is an emerging patient-centric model of health information
exchange, which is often outsourced to be stored at a third party, such as cloud providers.
In this project, we proposed a novel patient-centric framework and a suite of mechanisms
for data access control to PHRs stored in semi-trusted servers. To achieve fine-grained and
scalable data access control for PHRs, we leverage Attribute Based Encryption (ABE)<br>
techniques to encrypt each patient’s PHR file.
<h3>PRESENTATIONS</h3><hr>
